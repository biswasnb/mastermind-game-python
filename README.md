# Mastermind Game in Python

## Description

A simple implementation of the classic **Mastermind** game written in Python. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated 4-digit number. The player will receive feedback after each guess, indicating how many digits were guessed correctly. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

The game also validates the player's input to ensure they enter a 4-digit number.

## Game Rules

1. The computer generates a random 4-digit number.
2. The player attempts to guess the number.
3. After each guess, feedback is provided:
   - The game tells the player how many digits were guessed correctly.
   - The correct digits will be displayed in the correct positions.
4. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
5. Once the number is guessed correctly, the number of tries is displayed, and the player is congratulated.

## Features

- Random number generation using Python's `random` module.
- Input validation to ensure only a 4-digit number is entered.
- Real-time feedback on correct digits and positions.
- Tracks and displays the number of attempts.

## How to Play

1. Run the game in Python.
2. The game will prompt you to guess a 4-digit number.
3. If your guess is incorrect, the program will inform you how many digits are correct and in the correct position.
4. Keep guessing until you guess the number correctly.
5. Once you guess correctly, the game will display how many tries it took to win.
